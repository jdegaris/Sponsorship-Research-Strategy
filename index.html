			<h2>Sponsorship B2B</h2>
			<h3>DEMONSTRATE THE VALUE OF CLIENT ENTERTAINMENT AND CORPORATE HOSPITALITY</h3>
		</div>

		<div class="value">
				<h3>Brands</h3>
				<p>A more strategic view of client entertainment and corporate hospitality will help brands understand the value of their programs, and plan more effectively.  Benefits could be strategic, such as determining the balance of using assets for new business or for current clients.  Or, the benefits could be tactical, such as whether to give tickets to prospects or to ensure they are accompanied by a salesperson from the company.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="value">
				<h3>Properties</h3>
				<p>It's well-past time for properties to move beyond the testimonial letter.  A more rigorous evaluation of client entertainment will help properties demonstrate the value of their tickets, events, and hospitality as B2B sales tools. </p>
			</div>
			<div class="value">
				<h3>Economic Impact</h3> 
				<p>For many large-scale events, and sports in particular, the common method of determining the economic impact is to count "heads and beds".</p>
				<p>This completely discounts the B2B impact on the economy.  Unlike consumer spending, the "substitution effect" is much less likely in business.</p>
				<p>Consumer spending tends to stay local--money not spent on an event would likely be spent on something else in the area.  That's less likely to be true for businesses, which can look outside the area more easily in most industry categories.</p>
				<p>The potential impact is huge.  And it's measurable.	</p>
